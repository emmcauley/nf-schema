**A Nextflow plugin to work with validation of pipeline parameters and sample sheets.**

## Introduction

> [!IMPORTANT]
> nf-schema is the new version of the now deprecated [nf-validation](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-validation). Please follow the [migration guide](https://nextflow-io.github.io/nf-schema/latest/migration_guide/) to migrate your code to this new version.

This [Nextflow plugin](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/plugins.html#plugins) provides a number of functions that can be included into a Nextflow pipeline script to work with parameter and sample sheet schema. Using these functions you can:

- üìñ Print usage instructions to the terminal (for use with `--help`)
- ‚úçÔ∏è Print log output showing parameters with non-default values
- ‚úÖ Validate supplied parameters against the pipeline schema
- üìã Validate the contents of supplied sample sheet files
- üõ†Ô∏è Create a Nextflow channel with a parsed sample sheet

Supported sample sheet formats are CSV, TSV, JSON and YAML.

## Quick Start

Declare the plugin in your Nextflow pipeline configuration file:

```groovy title="nextflow.config"
plugins {
  id 'nf-schema@2.0.0'
}
```

This is all that is needed - Nextflow will automatically fetch the plugin code at run time.

> [!NOTE]
> The snippet above will always try to install the latest version, good to make sure
> that the latest bug fixes are included! However, this can cause difficulties if running
> offline. You can pin a specific release using the syntax `nf-schema@2.0.0`

You can now include the plugin helper functions into your Nextflow pipeline:

```groovy title="main.nf"
include { validateParameters; paramsHelp; paramsSummaryLog; samplesheetToList } from 'plugin/nf-schema'

// Print help message, supply typical command line usage for the pipeline
if (params.help) {
   log.info paramsHelp("nextflow run my_pipeline --input input_file.csv")
   exit 0
}

// Validate input parameters
validateParameters()

// Print summary of supplied parameters
log.info paramsSummaryLog(workflow)

// Create a new channel of metadata from a sample sheet passed to the pipeline through the --input parameter
ch_input = Channel.fromList(samplesheetToList(params.input, "assets/schema_input.json"))
```

## Dependencies
